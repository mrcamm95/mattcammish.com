      <h2>Less is More</h2>
      <p>The principle of "less is more" applies perfectly to web design. By removing unnecessary elements, we can focus the user's attention on what truly matters.</p>
      
      <h2>Typography Matters</h2>
      <p>Good typography is the foundation of minimalist design. Choose fonts that are readable and convey the right tone for your content.</p>
      
      <h2>Whitespace as a Design Element</h2>
      <p>Whitespace isn't empty spaceâ€”it's a powerful design tool that can improve readability and create visual hierarchy.</p>
      
      <p>Remember, minimalist design is about intentionality. Every element should have a purpose and contribute to the overall user experience.</p>
