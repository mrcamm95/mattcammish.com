        <h1>About this site</h1>

        <p>I mostly try to become a little wiser every day.</p>

        <p>
          By day I'm a product manager with expertise in growth and marketing. And by night, I'd class myself as an
          intellectual meathead ‚Äî you'll usually find me reading books, hitting the gym or training jiu-jitsu.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site hosts my thoughts, ideas and writing on a range of topics ‚Äî from marketing, growth, philosophy,
          personal development, psychology, finance to business and society. Plus, anything else worth sharing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also curated a list of{" "}
          <Link href="/recommendations">
            <strong>recommendations</strong>
          </Link>{" "}
          ‚Äî some have had a profound impact on my life.
        </p>

        <p>And I'd be delighted if you got in touch. I'm always open to a coffee or phone call.</p>

        <p>
